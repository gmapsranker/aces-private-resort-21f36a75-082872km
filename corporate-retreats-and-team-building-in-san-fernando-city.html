        "text": "Our corporate retreat packages start at a minimum of 15 persons, with rates beginning at ₱4,500 per person for day use and ₱6,500 per person for overnight stays. This includes exclusive use of our facilities, team building equipment, a dedicated events coordinator, meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner for overnight stays), and use of our conference rooms. For groups larger than 50 persons, we offer special bulk rates. Our maximum capacity is 120 persons for comfortable accommodation."

        "text": "We recommend booking at least 2 months in advance for corporate events, especially during peak seasons (October-December). To reserve, we require a 30% non-refundable deposit and signed booking agreement. The remaining balance is due 2 weeks before your event date. The reservation process starts with an initial consultation (in-person or virtual) to discuss your specific needs, followed by a customized proposal within 48 hours. We can hold your preferred date for 3 working days while you make your decision."

We also maintain flexible scheduling - if rain is forecast, we can adjust the program timing or switch to our indoor alternatives without compromising the team building experience. All bookings include both outdoor and indoor backup options at no additional cost."

Please inform us of any special dietary needs at least 1 week before your event. We provide detailed menu options during the planning phase and can customize meals accordingly. For groups with multiple dietary restrictions, we recommend scheduling a menu tasting session (available for groups of 50 or more) two weeks before the event."

If you choose to bring your own facilitator, we offer a facility-only rate with a 10% discount on the standard package price. However, they must attend a brief orientation session with our staff at least one day before the event and sign our safety waiver. We also require proof of their professional liability insurance."

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Booked Aces for our annual leadership retreat last month - 32 people from our regional sales team. The venue itself is stunning but what really stood out was how the staff handled all our last-minute schedule changes. Maria from events was super patient when we had to modify our team building activities due to unexpected rain. Only minor hiccup was some confusion with the AV setup on day 1, but they sorted it quickly. Food was consistently good - especially the breakfast buffet. Worth the 2-hour drive from Manila for sure.</div>
                    <div class="testimonial-author">– Michael T. Santos, Makati City</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Just wrapped up our 2-day company strategic planning here and wow! The private conference rooms are so well-designed - lots of natural light and the views of the mountains are incredible. Special shoutout to Carlo who went above and beyond to accommodate our dietary restrictions (we had 2 vegans and someone with gluten allergy). Would give 5 stars but the wifi was a bit spotty in some areas. Still definitely recommending this to other businesses!</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Best decision ever bringing our tech startup team here for our quarterly planning! The isolation from the city really helped us focus. Their team building facilitator Jake was amazing - he really understood our company culture and customized everything perfectly. The evening bonfire session was a highlight - really got everyone opening up. Rooms were spotless, staff remembered everyone's names by day 2, and the infinity pool was perfect for our post-meeting relaxation. Not cheap but 100% worth it for what you get. Already booked again for next quarter!</div>

                        <summary>What is your minimum group size for corporate retreats and what are the rates?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Our corporate retreat packages start at a minimum of 15 persons, with rates beginning at ₱4,500 per person for day use and ₱6,500 per person for overnight stays. This includes exclusive use of our facilities, team building equipment, a dedicated events coordinator, meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner for overnight stays), and use of our conference rooms. For groups larger than 50 persons, we offer special bulk rates. Our maximum capacity is 120 persons for comfortable accommodation.</div>

                        <summary>How far in advance should we book for a corporate event, and what's the reservation process?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">We recommend booking at least 2 months in advance for corporate events, especially during peak seasons (October-December). To reserve, we require a 30% non-refundable deposit and signed booking agreement. The remaining balance is due 2 weeks before your event date. The reservation process starts with an initial consultation (in-person or virtual) to discuss your specific needs, followed by a customized proposal within 48 hours. We can hold your preferred date for 3 working days while you make your decision.</div>

                        <summary>What happens if it rains during our outdoor team building activities?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">We have comprehensive wet weather contingency plans in place. Our 500-square-meter covered pavilion and indoor activity areas can accommodate all our team building programs. We also maintain flexible scheduling - if rain is forecast, we can adjust the program timing or switch to our indoor alternatives without compromising the team building experience. All bookings include both outdoor and indoor backup options at no additional cost.</div>

                        <summary>How do you handle special dietary requirements for corporate groups?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Our in-house catering team can accommodate various dietary requirements including vegetarian, vegan, halal, and food allergies. Please inform us of any special dietary needs at least 1 week before your event. We provide detailed menu options during the planning phase and can customize meals accordingly. For groups with multiple dietary restrictions, we recommend scheduling a menu tasting session (available for groups of 50 or more) two weeks before the event.</div>

                        <summary>Can we bring our own team building facilitator or do we need to use yours?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">While you're welcome to bring your own facilitator, our packages include certified team building professionals who are familiar with our facilities and equipment. If you choose to bring your own facilitator, we offer a facility-only rate with a 10% discount on the standard package price. However, they must attend a brief orientation session with our staff at least one day before the event and sign our safety waiver. We also require proof of their professional liability insurance.</div>
