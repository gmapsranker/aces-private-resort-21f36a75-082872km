However, we do occasionally have available dates for shorter notice bookings during off-peak months. A 30% non-refundable deposit is required to secure your date, with the balance due 30 days before the event."

While our garden venue is perfect for dry season ceremonies (December to May), we provide a beautiful covered pavilion area as a backup during rainy season (June to November). The pavilion can accommodate up to 200 guests and offers stunning views of our landscaped gardens. We make the final call on venue setup 5 hours before the ceremony based on weather conditions, at no additional cost."

However, catering must be arranged through our in-house team or our three accredited caterers due to kitchen facility requirements. Outside suppliers must provide proper business permits and insurance, and attend a venue orientation at least one month before the event."

                    <div class="testimonial-text">We had our dream wedding at Aces last March and I'm still getting messages from guests about how beautiful everything was. The garden ceremony setup was exactly what we wanted - not too over-the-top but still elegant. Grace from their events team was super patient with all my changes (sorry Grace! 😅). Only small hiccup was some confusion with the cocktail hour timing, but the staff handled it quickly. The food was fantastic - especially the lechon station! My husband's Chinese relatives were impressed with both the traditional and modern dishes. Worth every peso for making our day stress-free.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Just had my daughter's debut here last weekend. Place is stunning, especially at night with all the lights. A bit pricey compared to other venues we looked at, but you get what you pay for. The coordination team really knows their stuff. Special thanks to Ms. Jenny who helped us plan everything down to the smallest detail. Only wish they had more parking space available.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Napakaganda ng wedding namin sa Aces! We booked their mid-range package but honestly it felt super luxurious. The airconditioned tent saved our guests from the summer heat. DJ Mark was great, kept everyone dancing. Food portions were generous - the beef was perfectly cooked! Medyo matagal lang yung picture taking pero worth it naman kasi ang ganda ng garden backdrop. Will definitely recommend to friends planning their weddings. Thank you Aces team! ❤️</div>

                        <summary>How far in advance should we book for a wedding at Aces Private Resort?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">We recommend booking at least 8-12 months in advance, especially for peak season dates (December to February and June to September). Weekend dates are particularly in demand. However, we do occasionally have available dates for shorter notice bookings during off-peak months. A 30% non-refundable deposit is required to secure your date, with the balance due 30 days before the event.</div>

                        <summary>Can you accommodate outdoor ceremonies during rainy season in Pampanga?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Yes, we have contingency plans for wet weather. While our garden venue is perfect for dry season ceremonies (December to May), we provide a beautiful covered pavilion area as a backup during rainy season (June to November). The pavilion can accommodate up to 200 guests and offers stunning views of our landscaped gardens. We make the final call on venue setup 5 hours before the ceremony based on weather conditions, at no additional cost.</div>

                        <summary>Do you have preferred vendors, or can we bring our own suppliers?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">While we have a list of trusted local vendors in Angeles City and Pampanga who are familiar with our venue, you're welcome to bring your own suppliers. However, catering must be arranged through our in-house team or our three accredited caterers due to kitchen facility requirements. Outside suppliers must provide proper business permits and insurance, and attend a venue orientation at least one month before the event.</div>
