                    <div class="testimonial-text">Just got back from a 3-day stay at Aces with my family and wow - what a hidden gem! The zipline course was actually better than I expected (and I was nervous at first!). My kids couldn't get enough of the pool area. Only small complaint was that the restaurant was a bit slow during peak hours, had to wait 45 mins for lunch one day. But the staff, especially Kuya Jimmy at the adventure zone, made up for it with their super friendly service. Worth the 2-hour drive from Manila!</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Been here twice now - once for team building and just last weekend with my gf. Place has really improved since my first visit in 2021. The new glamping tents are awesome, very clean and the aircon works great (important in this weather!). Did the ATV trail and horseback riding. Bit pricey compared to other resorts but you get what you pay for. Special thanks to Mae at the front desk for helping with our late checkout.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Stayed at Aces for a quick weekend getaway from SG. Really loved the peaceful vibe and all the activities available. The archery instructor (I think his name was Carlo?) was super patient with us beginners. Food was good - try the sisig! My only suggestion would be to add more signs around the property, got lost trying to find the spa building lol. Will def be back next time I'm in PH.</div>
