                    <div class="testimonial-text">My husband surprised me with a weekend stay at Aces for our 15th anniversary last month. The private villa was absolutely beautiful - loved the infinity pool overlooking the mountains! The couples massage at their spa was probably the best I've had (though the pressure was almost too firm for me). Only small issue was our breakfast arrived 30 mins late one morning, but the staff was very apologetic and threw in some extra pastries. Overall a wonderful experience that helped us really unwind and reconnect. Will definitely be back!</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Just got back from a 3-day wellness retreat at Aces. Honestly wasn't sure what to expect since I'm not usually into the whole spa scene, but wow. Their yoga instructor Anna was incredible and really helped with my lower back issues. The meditation garden is so peaceful early in the morning. Food was super fresh - lots of organic options. My room (Villa 7) had this amazing outdoor shower. Only wish they had more evening activities, gets pretty quiet after 8pm.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Quick overnight stay here with my sisters last week. The grounds are gorgeous and well-maintained. Had their signature facial which was nice but tbh a bit overpriced for what you get. The staff were super friendly though, especially Rey at the front desk who helped us when we got lost finding our villa at night lol. Nice place if you need a quick escape from the city!</div>

                        <summary>How far in advance should I book for weekend stays or special occasions?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">For weekend stays, we recommend booking at least 2-3 weeks in advance as we often reach full capacity, especially during peak season (December-May). For special occasions or group bookings of 5 rooms or more, please book at least 1 month ahead. During local festivals in Pampanga like the Hot Air Balloon Festival, we suggest booking 2-3 months in advance. We require a 50% deposit to secure your reservation.</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">For room bookings, we offer full refunds for cancellations made at least 7 days before check-in. Cancellations within 3-6 days of check-in will receive a 50% refund. For cancellations less than 72 hours before check-in, the deposit becomes non-refundable.
